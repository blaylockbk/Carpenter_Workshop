I have a lot of useful python tools and keep them organized in this workshop. I enjoy woodworking and think there are a lot of analogies between carpentry and programing.

This package is as an optional dependency to [`Herbie`](https://github.com/blaylockbk/Herbie), [`goes2go`](https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go), and [`SynopticPy`](https://github.com/blaylockbk/SynopticPy) and anything else I create.

# Install

Installation is easy with pip.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/blaylockbk/Carpenter_Workshop.git
```

Or, clone the repo and install as an "editable" package (so you can pull changes).

```
git clone https://github.com/blaylockbk/Carpenter_Workshop.git
cd Carpenter_Workshop
pip install -e .
```
