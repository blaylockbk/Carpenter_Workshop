# ðŸŽ¨ Paint: A collection of color maps

## NWS Standard Color Maps
These are used by the National Weather Service in their public products you see on social media and elsewhere. The color scales are based on the proposal of consistent color scale in 2018. I haven't been able to find an updated document, so this may be outdated, but I haven't seen any difference in the social media posts I've seen recently. See the PDF `NWS_Standard_Color_Curve_Sumamry.pdf` in this directory.

## Terrain
A custom terrain color map I think looks nice.

## Land use
Color codes for different land use specified by MODIS and NLCD products.

## Air Quality
Typical air quality codes for Ozone and PM 2.5.

## Cloud Cover

**Future Work**

It would be interesting to implement this sort of coloring for high/medium/low clouds using the HSV color scale developed at [ECMWF](https://apps.ecmwf.int/webapps/opencharts/products/medium-clouds).
